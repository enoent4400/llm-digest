# LLM Digest

My humble contribution to the wave of vibe coded slop ðŸ« 

Transform AI conversations into structured insights. Import chats from various AI platforms and visualize the information through different formats like mind maps, timelines.

## Features

- **Multi-platform support**: Import conversations from ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, and other AI platforms
- **Bring your own API key**: Use your own API keys for AI processing
- **Self-hosted**: Deploy on your own infrastructure
- **Open source**: MIT licensed

### Planned Visualizations

- [ ] Executive summaries for quick insights
- [ ] Code organization for technical conversations
- [ ] Mind maps (React Flow implementation)
- [ ] Blog post generation from digests (with AI-generated images and SEO optimization)

## Quick Start

### Development with Mock Database

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Development with PocketBase

```bash
# Setup PocketBase
npm run pocketbase:setup
npm run pocketbase:start

# In another terminal, start the app
DATABASE_TYPE=pocketbase npm run dev
```

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and configure:

```bash
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_TYPE=mock  # or 'pocketbase'
POCKETBASE_URL=http://localhost:8090

# AI Provider
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Production Deployment

### Build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### PocketBase Setup

```bash
