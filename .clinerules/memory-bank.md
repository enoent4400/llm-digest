## Brief overview

Global rule for Cline's Memory Bank system - a documentation-driven approach to maintain project context across memory resets. This rule defines how Cline should work with memory bank files to ensure continuity and precision in development work.

## Communication style

- MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task without exception
- Should reference memory bank files throughout conversations to maintain context
- Focus on precise documentation rather than recollection of past conversations

## Development workflow

- Follow the established Memory Bank file hierarchy and relationships
- Update memory bank files when discovering new project patterns or implementing significant changes
- Review all memory bank files when user requests **update memory bank**
- Maintain activeContext.md and progress.md as primary tracking documents for current state

## Coding best practices

- Document technical decisions and patterns in systemPatterns.md
- Track current work focus and next steps in activeContext.md
- Record project insights and learnings in activeContext.md
- Keep progress.md updated with what works, what's left to build, and known issues

## Project context

- Use projectbrief.md as the foundation document that shapes all other memory bank files
- Reference productContext.md for understanding why the project exists and user experience goals
- Consult techContext.md for technologies, dependencies, and development setup information
- Create additional memory bank files/folders when they help organize complex features or documentation

## Other guidelines

- Memory Bank is the ONLY link to previous work after memory resets
- Files must be maintained with precision and clarity as effectiveness depends entirely on accuracy
- Never skip the memory bank reading process - it's mandatory for every task
- Memory bank files take precedence over recalled conversation history
