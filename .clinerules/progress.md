## Progress: LLM Digest

### What Works

- Memory Bank system is initialized with core documentation files
- Project structure is established with Next.js App Router
- Multiple AI provider integrations are in place (Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Copilot)
- Basic content parsing capabilities for HTML and JSON
- PocketBase database integration with mock data support
- Platform detection utilities are functional

### What's Left to Build

- AI digest generation pipeline implementation
- Dashboard UI components for digest management
- Additional content format parsers
- Offline development mode enhancements
- Digest visualization components
- API route handlers for digest operations
- Testing suite expansion

### Current Status

- Memory Bank system fully initialized
- Core project documentation in place
- Development environment ready
- Basic architecture established

### Known Issues

- None at this time

### Evolution of Project Decisions

- Established documentation-driven development approach
- Defined core memory bank file hierarchy
- Set up multi-provider AI architecture
- Implemented modular parser system design
