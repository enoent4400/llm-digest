## Active Context: LLM Digest

### Current Work Focus

- Memory Bank system initialization and documentation
- Core project structure understanding
- Multi-provider AI integration architecture

### Recent Changes

- Created Memory Bank rule file (.clinerules/memory-bank.md)
- Initialized core Memory Bank documentation files
- Established project brief and technical context documentation

### Next Steps

- Continue developing AI digest generation pipeline
- Implement content parsing for various formats
- Enhance offline development mode with mock data
- Build dashboard components for digest management

### Active Decisions and Considerations

- Maintaining strict documentation-driven development approach
- Following Memory Bank hierarchy for all future context management
- Using TypeScript for type safety across all components
- Implementing modular parser system for extensibility

### Important Patterns and Preferences

- Component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Repository pattern for database operations
- Factory pattern for AI provider selection
- Strategy pattern for digest visualization types

### Learnings and Project Insights

- Project uses Next.js App Router with server/client component architecture
- Multiple AI providers are integrated for redundancy and flexibility
- PocketBase serves as the primary database solution
- Extensible prompt system allows for various digest formats
